# MagLev &mdash; Magnetic Levitation Train

This is a DIY project for a simple magnetic levitation train model using permanent magnets and wood as major components. Educational STEM project demonstrating magnetic repulsion principles.

```
Magnetic levitation system with permanent magnets (15×4×4mm, N-pole up):

RAIL (80mm wide):
- Two vertical columns of magnets (4mm wide × 15mm long from top)
- Positioned 5mm from left and right edges
- at least 8 magnets per column

VEHICLE (80mm wide):
- Three horizontal rows of magnets (15mm wide × 4mm deep from top)
- Two magnets per row, aligned above rail columns

ASCII top view:
RAIL: Two columns of ┌─┐ symbols (magnets)
VEHICLE: Four rows of ┌───────┐ symbols (magnets rotated 90°)

Goal: Vehicle floats/levitates above rail, can move up/down.
```

## ⚠️ Safety Warnings

- **Strong magnets!** Keep away from electronic devices, credit cards, and pacemakers
- **Choking hazard** for small children
- Do not use hot glue for the magnets since otherwise they will lose their magnetization
